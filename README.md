## Backend Development Environment
We will be  using Python Django Framework for our backend development so, we need to install python3.10.8
Before installing, first confirm if it is already installed using this command

### Requirements

* Django 4.2,4.1,4.0,3.2,3.1,3.0

```
python3 â€“version

// Outputs
// Python 3.10.x
```

If you do not see the output outlined in the code block above, it means you do not have Python installed and so,you need to install it.
```
Installing Python

sudo apt update -y \
sudo apt install software-properties-common \
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa \
sudo apt update \
